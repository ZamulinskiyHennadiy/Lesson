      <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
        instructions, they've moved to <span class="go"> their own section</span>. Continue reading for an introduction
        to the

        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using <span
          class="go">React</span> and the app
        platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as
        to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="next"> bundles of
          reusable, nestable
          code</span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in
        React Native.

      <p>
        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
        make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
        serve as a refresher course.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>+components.</b>
        The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>&#43 JSX.</b>
        React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like
        so:
      </p><span class="jazz">&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt&#47Text&gt</span>.
      <p>
        The React docs have<span class="go"> a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more.
        Because JSX is
        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="jazz">name</span> for the
        cat,name, and
        embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="jazz">&ltText&gt</span>
      </p>
      <p><br><b>&#43 props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>&#43 state.</b>
        While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
        render,
        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
        data
        that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
        components
        memory!
      </p>
    </case>
    <case>
      <div class="headers">
        <h2>handling text input</h2>
        <span>Chapter 4</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
          class="next">onChangeText</span>
        prop
        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
        that
        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
        different
        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
        sentence
        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
